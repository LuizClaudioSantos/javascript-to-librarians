# Javascritp to Librarians

Let me explain you about the aim of this project, a friend of mine was leaining Javascript and she showed me her code, the code looked like the code that I used to write in 1999. After 30 minutes, in a lunch conversation, she was able to make a lot of inprovements in hers code, so this project suppose to help people with previous knowledge of Javascript move one ster forward. You can see detailed explantion about the technical aspectes of the project in my [blog](http://luizclaudiosantos.me/?s=javascript+for+librarians).
